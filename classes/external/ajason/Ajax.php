    * AJASON is a PHP 5 library and JavaScript client for the upcoming
    * Web technology called AJAX. AJAX permits data to be fetched
    * asynchronously without the need for reloading the Web page and
    * thus allows the development of interactive GUI-like Web applications.
    * JSON is a lightweight data interchange format which is used by AJASON
    * to exchange data between server and client.
