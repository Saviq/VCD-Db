VCD-db README ($Date$)


INSTALLATION

1)  Unzip the VCD-db file on your webserver. 
2)  You must have a database access / or use SQLite/Webservices as a backend. 
3)  Create an empty database.
	At the moment the following database types are supported 
	a) MySQL (3.x/4.x/5.x) 
	b) Microsoft SQL (7, 2000 and 2005) 
	c) Postgre SQL 7.4, 7.5, 8, 8.1 (Even without OID's enabled)
	d) IBM DB2 (7.2 and up) 
	e) Oracle 9/10g
	f) SQLite
	
4)  If your webserver is on a Win32 box this step is unneccassary,
	otherwise if your webserver is on a Unix/Linux box, you must have an Shell Access 
	or a ftp access to chmod some files and folders. Open up a console session to your box and
	go to the directory where you extracted the VCD-DB zip file.
	Enter the following commands: 
	
	touch config.php
	chmod 666 config.php
	chmod 0777 upload
	chmod 0777 upload/cache
	chmod 0777 upload/covers
	chmod 0777 upload/nfo
	chmod 0777 upload/pornstars
	chmod 0777 upload/screenshots/albums
	chmod 0777 upload/screenshots/generated
	chmod 0777 upload/thumbnails

5)  After a successfull install, delete the setup folder and 
    if you are running VCD-db on a linux box chmod the file config.php back to 644
    to prevent any further writing or modification to the file.


UPGRADING

Upgrading from 0.984, 0.985, 0.986 or 0.990
	- At last a painless upgrade :) 
	  Simply overwrite all existing files from the new zip/tar file.
	  (Beware MacOS users not to overwrite the upload folder)
	  Open the vcddb/setup/upgrade.php on your server to finish the upgrade.
	  Delete the setup folder and start using VCD-db again.

Upgrading from 0.982 or 0.983
	1) Extract all the files from the zip/tar archive and overwrite your existing VCD-db installation
	2) First, the file classes/VCDConstants.php is no longer used, but dont delete it yet.
	   Goto the vcddb/setup directory and copy the file config.default to your vcddb root directory
	   and rename it to config.php.  Then enter the same database settings in the new config file that 
	   you had in your file classes/VCDConstants.php, you can also update other settings you might have modified
	   such as proxy server setttings and LDAP directory settings.  Now you can delete the file classes/VCDConstants.php
	3) There are 4 changes that need to be done on your database.
		A) Change the size of the field metadata_value in the table vcd_Metadata to VARCHAR(250).
		   If using MySQL you can use the following query to modify the table for you in your query tool..
		   ALTER TABLE `vcd_MetaData` CHANGE `metadata_value` `metadata_value` VARCHAR( 250 ) NOT NULL 
		B) 2 New columns need to be added to the table vcd_RssFeeds after the column "feed_url", they are ..
			isAdult, tinyint(4) and isSite, tinyint(4) both which allow NULL values.
			If using MySQL you can use the following query to modify the table for you in your query tool..
			ALTER TABLE `vcd_RssFeeds` ADD `isAdult` TINYINT NULL DEFAULT '0', ADD `isSite` TINYINT NULL DEFAULT '0';
		C) New role needs to be created in VCD-db, to do that you must add the following entry to your vcd_UserRoles table
		   User = "Adult User", Description = "User with Adult options enabled"
		   Use this SQL query to insert the data => 
		   INSERT INTO `vcd_UserRoles`(`role_name` , `role_description` ) VALUES ('Adult User', 'User with Adult options enabled');
		D) Finally we need to update one entry in the vcd_MetaDataTypes table, you can do that with the 
		   following SQL query on the table vcd_MetaDataTypes ..
		   UPDATE `vcd_MetaDataTypes` SET `type_name` = 'defaultdvd', `type_description` = 'Default DVD Settings' WHERE type_id =20
		E)  Open the vcddb/setup/upgrade.php on your server to finish the upgrade.
	  4) Thats it .. you can now enjoy your updated VCD-db :), ps. sorry for being lazy and not writing an update script :)
	  5) If you want to do some cleaning up .. you can delete the folder classes/languages.  The new language system
	  	 uses XML files stored in /includes/languages/

		   
UPGRADING FROM OLDER VERSIONS
  	You will have to d/l an older release such as VCD-db 0.983 from sf.net/projects/vcddb and
  	upgrade from that version.  Then after that, upgrade again with latest version.
  	Since VCD-db is still in beta stage, I'm not providing upgrade support for very old releases.

   
APPLICATION NOTES
1) You can change the template that VCD-db uses by modifying the "STYLE" constant in the config.php
   file, for example try changing it to "includes/templates/exprm/" for a new look.

2) All major settings are stored in the "config.php" file.

3) If your text gets escaped in the database (like this-> "Mary\'s") then edit your php.ini and set
  "magic_quotes_gpc = Off" and "magic_quotes_runtime = Off" to disable them.
  
4) You can access the XML RSS feed generated by VCD-db under the "yourserver.com/vcddb/rss/" path.

5) If you have made your own templates or translation, please send them to me (konni the author) and I will
   include it in future releases.  You can also translate online at http://vcddb.konni.com/translator
   
6) When LDAP is used for authentication (defined in the config.php) users can not register,
   All they have to do is login with their LDAP account and then the account in automatically created for them.
